🙋‍♂️ About Me

🔭 I’m currently working on deploying a Medusa headless commerce platform on AWS ECS Fargate with Terraform and GitHub Actions.
🌱 I’m learning ArgoCD, Terraform, Prometheus, and advanced Kubernetes to enhance my DevOps expertise.
🧠 I enjoy building scalable, observable, and production-ready systems using cloud-native technologies.
💬 Ask me about Spring Boot, CI/CD, AWS, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, or Medusa.
⚡ Fun fact: I love automating deployments and sipping ☕ while watching pipelines succeed.

🚀 Featured Project: Medusa E-Commerce Deployment
For my internship, I built a production-ready deployment of the Medusa headless commerce platform on AWS ECS Fargate using Terraform and GitHub Actions. Key features include:

Infrastructure as Code: Used Terraform to provision a VPC, ECR, ECS cluster, ALB, Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL), and AWS ElastiCache (Redis).
CI/CD Pipeline: Automated Docker image builds and ECS deployments with GitHub Actions.
Scalability: Implemented auto-scaling for 2-4 ECS tasks based on 70% CPU utilization.
Troubleshooting:
Fixed psql and redis-cli absence with sudo apt install postgresql-client redis-tools.
Resolved PostgreSQL credential issues by resetting the password for user pearl.
Bypassed Medusa CLI errors (TypeError: The "id" argument must be of type string) using npm run dev.


Cost Efficiency: Used mock credentials for local testing to avoid AWS costs, with production-ready RDS/ElastiCache integration.
